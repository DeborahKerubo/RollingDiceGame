# RollingDiceGame
Let’s roll some dice! This is  a program that allows the user to choose to roll between 1 and 100 dice between 1 and 1000 times.
For as many times as the user has indicated, the program  simulates rolling the number of dice specified and determine the total for the roll. The range of possible values will be based on the number of dice specified. For example: for 1 die the roll value will be between 1 and 6; for 4 dice the roll value will be between 4 and 24.
The program  uses an array to keep count of the number of times each possible total is rolled. For example, if rolling 1 die the array values will represent how many times a 1 is rolled, how many times a 2 is rolled, how many times a 3 is rolled, how many times a 4 is rolled, how many times a 5 is rolled, how many times a 6 is rolled….if rolling 3 dice, the array values will represent how many times a 3 through 18 is rolled. (Note: the array does not store the values that are being rolled – instead each value in the array is a count of how many times the value associated with the index has been rolled.)
After all the rolls are complete the program  prints the results in a histogram where each roll is represented by an *. The histogram should be printed to the screen and to a file. There is a separate file for each “play” in the program session. These files can be overwritten with each run of the program. The program  contains a separate method that is used to print out the histogram.
It allows the user  to “play” as many times as they like.
